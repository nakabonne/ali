A load testing tool aimed to perform real-time analysis, inspired by [vegeta](https://github.com/tsenart/vegeta) and [jplot](https://github.com/rs/jplot).

`ali` comes with a simple terminal based UI, lets you generate HTTP requests and plot the results in real-time.
With it, real-time analysis can be done on the terminal.

## Usage
### Quickstart

```
$ ali
```

Click on the target URL input field, give the URL and press Enter. Then the attack will be launched with default options.

### Options

| Name | Description | Default |
|------|-------------|---------|
| Rate Limit | The request rate per time unit to issue against the targets. Give 0 then it will send requests as fast as possible. | 50 |
| Duration | The amount of time to issue requests to the targets. Give `0s` for an infinite attack. Press `Ctrl-C` to stop. Valid time units are "ns", "us" (or "µs"), "ms", "s", "m", "h". | 10s |
| Timeout | The timeout for each request. `0s` means to disable timeouts. Valid time units are "ns", "us" (or "µs"), "ms", "s", "m", "h". | 30s |
| Method | An HTTP request method for each request. | GET |
| Header | A request header to be sent. | empty |
| Body | The file whose content will be set as the http request body. | empty |

## Features

### Plot in real-time
Currently it only plots latencies, but in the near future more metrics will be drawn as well.

### Visualize the attack progress
This will help you during long tests.

### Mouse support
With the help of [mum4k/termdash](https://github.com/mum4k/termdash), it's intuitive to operate.
