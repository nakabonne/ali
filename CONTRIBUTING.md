# Contributing
If you are willing to contribute, first of all I really appreciate you!
This guide walks you through how to contribute step-by-step.

1. It's typically best to open a new issue describing the bug or feature you're intending to work on. Even if you think it's relatively minor, it could be helpful to know what people are working on at first.
1. Fork this repository by following [the typical process](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/quickstart/fork-a-repo), and setup a new branch to work in.
1. Modify code. It requires Go version 1.16 or greater.
1. Run `go fmt` on your code before committing it.
1. If you want to debug your change, just run `go build` then execute it with `./ali`.
